# property-noti

This application was made by only me for someone close to me.

It is build using
- Ionic 5
- React
- LocalStorage
- Typescript

Sends Notification to device when an property-event is nearing (can be set by the user) at 12am. However, the Notification. Date cannot be set after the End Date. 

Based on the specification provided by the requester, there will be no setting of times allowed (e.g. 10am - 10pm, etc)

This application does not require internet to function. As data is stored inside your device cache (localstorage).
